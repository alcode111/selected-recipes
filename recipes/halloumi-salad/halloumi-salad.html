            <h3 class="steps-heading">Steps</h3>
                <h4 class="step-1">Step 1</h4>
                <p>Cut the peel and pith away from the oranges. 
                Use a small serrated knife to segment the orange, catching any juices in a bowl,
                then squeeze any excess juice from the off-cut pith into the bowl as well. 
                Add the mustard, honey, vinegar, oil and some seasoning to the bowl and mix well.</p>
        
                <h4 class="step-2">Step 2</h4>
                <p>Using a vegetable peeler, peel carrot ribbons into the dressing bowl and toss gently. 
                Heat a drizzle of oil in a frying pan and cook the halloumi for a few mins until golden on both sides. 
                Toss the watercress through the dressed carrots. Arrange the watercress mixture on plates and top with the halloumi and oranges.</p>
